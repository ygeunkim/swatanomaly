\title{Squared l2 Distance between two windows}
\usage{
compute_euc(x, y)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{NumericMatrix. first window.}

\item{y}{NumericMatrix. second window.}
}
\value{
double. squared l2 distance matrix form.
}
\description{
This function gives distance matrix between two windows in multivariate time series
}
\details{
Compute
\deqn{d = x_{ij} - y_{kl}}
element-wise. After that,
\deqn{\frac{\sqrt{\sum{d}}}{wp}}
where w is the wize of window, and p is the number of variables.
